# Sara - AI-powered Executive Assistant

Sara is an AI-powered executive assistant developed with Python and leveraging the OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for understanding and generating human-like text based on user instructions. Sara is unique in that she has her own email address, allowing for autonomous email management. She integrates with various APIs from Google, Microsoft, and Zoom, enabling seamless interaction with commonly used productivity tools. Through machine learning, Sara adapts to the user's needs, offering highly customizable experiences.

## Features

1. Task Management: Using the Google Tasks API and Microsoft To Do API, Sara can create, update, and delete tasks based on user instructions, and set reminders for these tasks. She uses natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of the GPT-3.5 model to parse the tasks and reminders input by users, ensuring the task management is accurate and as per user requirements.

2. Schedule Management: Sara utilizes Google Calendar API and Microsoft Outlook Calendar API to manage the user's schedule. She can schedule, reschedule, and display appointments by making POST and GET requests to these APIs. In addition, Sara uses the Zoom API to schedule meetings on the Zoom platform directly, which includes creating a new meeting, updating an existing meeting, or deleting a meeting.

3. Email Management: Sara leverages the Gmail API and Microsoft Graph API to send, receive, and manage emails from her own email address. By using the GPT-3.5 model, Sara can draft emails based on user commands, making email management autonomous and efficient.

4. Customization: Sara uses machine learning algorithms to learn from user interactions and preferences over time. User preferences can be stored in a database and retrieved whenever needed to customize the responses.

## Performance Metrics

Sara's performance is gauged based on various quantitative and qualitative metrics. These include user satisfaction rates collected via feedback forms, user engagement rates calculated based on frequency and duration of interactions, successful task completion rates measured by comparing expected and actual task outputs, and the accuracy and reliability of schedule and email management checked through user feedback and error logs.

## Dependencies

Sara's functionality heavily relies on the following dependencies:

1. Python 3.8
2. Flask framework
3. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model
4. OpenAI API
5. Gmail API
6. Microsoft Graph API
7. Google Calendar API
8. Microsoft Outlook Calendar API
9. Google Tasks API
10. Microsoft To Do API
11. Zoom API

## Limitations

While Sara is highly capable, there are certain limitations:

1. The accuracy and reliability of responses depend on the capabilities of the GPT-3.5 model.
2. Email and calendar management depend on user permissions and the specific limitations of the integrated APIs.
3. Zoom meeting management requires user permissions.
4. Customization is limited by the capabilities of the underlying AI model and the APIs used.

## Tech Stack

Sara's backend is written in Python 3.8, leveraging the Flask framework for managing RESTful API requests. The AI functionalities are driven by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model which is accessed via the OpenAI API. Email, Calendar, Task, and Meeting management functionalities are provided by their respective APIs: Gmail API, Google Calendar API, Google Tasks API, Microsoft Graph API, Microsoft Outlook Calendar API, Microsoft To Do API, and Zoom API.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The web application for Sara will feature a modern and intuitive GUI, designed following contemporary UX/UI principles to ensure a smooth user experience. Here's a detailed description of key GUI features:

1. Interactive Chat Interface: A chat interface will be available for users to interact with Sara directly. This chat box will have a clear division between the user's input and Sara's response, with different colors or fonts to distinguish between the two. The chat interface will also support rich media such as images, hyperlinks, and possibly voice messages in future iterations.

2. Dashboard: The dashboard will provide an overview of the user's tasks, schedule, and emails. Key metrics such as upcoming tasks, pending emails, and next scheduled appointments will be displayed here. The dashboard design will focus on clarity and simplicity, showing only the most important information.

3. Task Management Interface: This interface will present tasks in an organized manner, possibly using a Kanban board or a simple list view. Users can create, update, or delete tasks directly through this interface. There will also be functionality to mark tasks as complete or in-progress.

4. Schedule Management Interface: An interactive calendar view will allow users to view and manage their schedule. Appointments can be added, updated, or deleted directly from this view. Zoom meetings scheduled by Sara will also appear in this calendar.

5. Email Management Interface: The email interface will resemble a traditional email client where users can view, send, and manage their emails. Drafts created by Sara will appear here for review and modification before sending.

6. Customization and Settings: A dedicated settings page will allow users to customize Sara's behavior according to their needs. These settings could include the frequency of reminders, the format of emails, preferred meeting times, etc. Users will also be able to manage their linked Google, Microsoft, and Zoom accounts from this page.

7. User Authentication: Sara's web application will include a standard login/register interface, with additional options for password recovery and account deletion. The design of these pages will emphasize security and privacy, assuring users that their data is safe.

The GUI for Sara's web application will be designed with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness, keeping the design clean and the navigation intuitive. Responsiveness will also be a key design goal, ensuring the interface adapts well to various screen sizes and devices.
