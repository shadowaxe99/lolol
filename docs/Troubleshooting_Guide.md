# Troubleshooting Guide

This troubleshooting guide provides solutions to common problems that users may encounter while installing, configuring, or using Sara.

## Problem: Installation Error
If you encounter an error during the installation process, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Check that you have Python 3.8 installed on your system. You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   python --version
   ```
   If Python is not installed or the version is incorrect, download and install Python 3.8 from the official Python website.

2. Ensure that you have all the necessary packages installed. You can use pip, the Python package installer, to install the required packages. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command will install all the necessary packages specified in the requirements.txt file.

3. Make sure you have cloned the project repository correctly. Double-check that you have the correct repository URL and that you have the necessary permissions to access it. Use the following command to clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the project repository.
