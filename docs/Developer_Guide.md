# Developer Guide

The Developer Guide provides a detailed explanation of Sara's architecture, how each part interacts with others, and guidance on debugging common issues, adding new features, and improving performance.

## Architecture Overview

Sara's backend is written in Python 3.8 and leverages the Flask framework for managing RESTful API requests. The AI functionalities are driven by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, which is accessed via the OpenAI API. Email, Calendar, Task, and Meeting management functionalities are provided by their respective APIs: Gmail API, Google Calendar API, Google Tasks API, Microsoft Graph API, Microsoft Outlook Calendar API, Microsoft To Do API, and Zoom API.

## Debugging

When debugging Sara, it is important to consider the following:

1. Check the logs: Logs can provide valuable information about errors or unexpected behavior. Make sure to enable logging and review the logs for any relevant messages.

2. Test in isolation: When encountering an issue, try to isolate the problem by testing the specific functionality or component that is causing the problem. This can help narrow down the root cause and make debugging easier.

3. Use debugging tools: Python provides various debugging tools that can help identify and fix issues. Tools like pdb (Python Debugger) and logging can be used to step through the code and inspect variables at runtime.

4. Review the code: Sometimes, the issue may be due to a logical error or a mistake in the code. Review the code carefully to identify any potential issues or mistakes.

## Adding New Features

To add new features to Sara, follow these steps:

1. Identify the feature: Clearly define the new feature you want to add and understand its requirements and scope.

2. Design the feature: Plan the implementation of the feature, including any changes to the architecture, APIs, or user interface.

3. Implement the feature: Write the necessary code to implement the new feature. Make sure to follow best practices and adhere to the existing code structure and style.

4. Test the feature: Thoroughly test the new feature to ensure it works as expected and does not introduce any regressions or issues.

5. Document the feature: Update the relevant documentation, including the API reference, user guide, and any other relevant documentation, to reflect the new feature.

6. Review and deploy: Have the code reviewed by other team members to ensure quality and correctness. Once approved, deploy the new feature to the production environment.

## Improving Performance

To improve Sara's performance, consider the following:

1. Optimize API calls: Minimize the number of API calls and optimize the data sent and received. Use batch requests, caching, and other techniques to reduce latency and improve response times.

2. Use efficient algorithms and data structures: Review the code and algorithms used in Sara to identify any areas where performance can be improved. Consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures to reduce computational complexity.

3. Profile the code: Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the code. This can help pinpoint areas that need optimization and guide the optimization efforts.

4. Monitor and analyze performance metrics: Continuously monitor and analyze performance metrics to identify areas for improvement. Use tools like APM (Application Performance Monitoring) to gain insights into the performance of different components and identify areas that need attention.

5. Optimize resource usage: Optimize the usage of system resources, such as memory and CPU, to improve performance. Identify and fix any resource leaks or inefficiencies in the code.
